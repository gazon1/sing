# test-execution-integrity

## Purpose

A test run is a measurement. A green build says *the assertions that ran passed* —
not that the suite ran at all, not that its coverage held, and not that the gates
watching it still work.

That distinction is not theoretical here. `-Ptest.tags=fast,slow` selected 16 of 218
test classes and CI stayed green for months: no navigation test and no desktop flow
test had ever run. The suite count is now gated, but the same class of defect has
three more faces — a test silently skipped, coverage silently lost, and a gate script
silently broken — and this spec pins all of them.

These requirements constrain the **verification posture**, not the product. No
requirement here changes what the app does.

## Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-1 Executed test counts are a floor, not a report

CI SHALL compare the number of executed test classes and tests per source set against
a committed floor, and SHALL fail when a source set runs fewer than the floor records.

The floor SHALL be the smallest count any legitimate run produces — the default local
run, which excludes `@Tag("slow")` — so that a fuller CI run is never mistaken for a
regression.

**Rationale:** `includeTags` matches per class. A class can stop being selected — an
untagged class, a JUnit 4 class on the Vintage engine, a narrowed filter — with no
error and a green task. Gradle reports `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` for a run that executed
nothing.

#### Scenario: A class loses its tag

- **Given** the baseline records 190 classes / 1519 tests for `shared:jvmTest`
- **When** a test class's `@Tag` is removed
- **Then** `scripts/check-test-runs.py` exits non-zero and names the source set and the
  counts it observed

#### Scenario: Tests are added

- **Given** the run executes more classes than the floor records
- **Then** the gate passes, and the floor is raised in the same commit

### Requirement: REQ-2 No test may be skipped silently

The same gate SHALL treat the skipped-test count as a **ceiling of zero** for every
source set, and SHALL fail when any test reports as skipped.

A skipped test is invisible to a count floor because JUnit counts a skipped testcase
inside `tests=` exactly like a passing one. `@Disabled` on a class, or an assumption
guard that starts failing, removes real coverage while the task stays green.

**Rationale:** `TaskOutgoingLinksTest` sat `@Disabled` for a month behind a fully
green task, with an ADR explaining why the cause had been misdiagnosed.

#### Scenario: A class is disabled

- **Given** a class covering 15 tests is annotated `@Disabled`
- **When** the suite runs
- **Then** the gate exits non-zero, naming the source set and the skipped count

#### Scenario: A conditional test stops applying

- **Given** a test guarded by an assumption that no longer holds
- **When** the suite runs
- **Then** the gate fails for the same reason — a missing test is still a missing test

### Requirement: REQ-3 Coverage is a floor over the project's own packages

CI SHALL compute instruction, branch and line coverage over the project's own packages
from the Kover XML report, and SHALL fail when any of the three falls below its
committed floor.

Coverage SHALL be measured from a report in which the main test task is instrumented.
Excluding a test task from instrumentation does not reduce coverage, it stops the
measurement — and the resulting number describes the Gradle configuration rather than
the code. Kover's instrumentation SHALL be filtered to the project's own packages
instead of being switched off wholesale, so third-party bytecode never enters the
accumulator.

**Rationale:** With `jvmTest` excluded from instrumentation the report claimed 10.5%
instruction coverage; with instrumentation filtered to `com.singularity.todo.*` the
same suite measures 23.0%. The first number was an artefact.

#### Scenario: Coverage drops

- **Given** the recorded floor for instruction coverage
- **When** the measured value falls below it
- **Then** the gate exits non-zero and names the metric and the delta

#### Scenario: A test source set stops being measured

- **Given** a change that silently excludes a test task from instrumentation
- **When** the gate runs
- **Then** coverage falls below the floor and CI fails, because a vanished test task
  looks exactly like lost coverage

### Requirement: REQ-4 The gates are themselves tested

Every verification script under `scripts/` SHALL have unit tests under `scripts/tests/`,
and the suite SHALL run as part of both `./check.sh` and CI.

A regression inside a gate script disables that gate silently — the same failure shape
the gates exist to detect, one level up. The tests SHALL cover the failure direction
(a drop, a skipped test, a missing report) as well as the passing direction, so a
gate that has stopped detecting cannot report success.

**Rationale:** `scripts/tests/` already existed with tests for
`find-unwired-surfaces.py`, and nothing ran them.

#### Scenario: A gate stops detecting

- **Given** a change that makes the test-count gate always return success
- **When** the gate's own test suite runs
- **Then** the drop-detection test fails

### Requirement: REQ-5 Flakiness is measured between runs, not assumed

The CI job SHALL publish the JUnit XML of every run, and SHALL compare each run against
the previous successful run on the same branch, reporting tests whose status flipped.

A test that fails in one run and passes in the next has proven itself nondeterministic
regardless of what either run reported. The comparison SHALL annotate the run rather
than mask it: a failure still fails the build.

Failures that are understood SHALL be recorded in
`config/docs/flaky-baseline.txt` with the reason. An unacknowledged failure SHALL fail
the analysis; an acknowledged one SHALL be reported.

**Rationale:** Two flakes in this repository's recent history were each observed once,
never reproduced, and ended up as prose in the deferred backlog rather than as a
signal.

#### Scenario: A test failed in the previous run and passes now

- **Given** the previous run recorded a failure for `TaskDetailCoordinatorGraphTest`
- **When** this run passes it
- **Then** the run summary lists it as a flake witness, and the build still reports its
  own result

#### Scenario: A new failure appears

- **Given** a test fails that is not in the flaky baseline
- **When** the analysis runs
- **Then** it exits non-zero and names the test
