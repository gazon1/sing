Markers that surface as Critical: `**Always**`, `**Never**`, `**MUST**`.

## Critical

- **Always** use `koinBridge { ... }` in any Koin factory that calls a `suspend` function. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- **Never** use `GlobalScope.launch { ... }` inside factories — non-deterministic. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- **Never** use raw `runBlocking { ... }` inside `module { ... }` blocks. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- **Always** bind both `single<PromptExecutorPort>` and `single<PromptExecutor>`; `PromptExecutorPort` is for the streaming executor inside `KoogAgentService`, `PromptExecutor` is for the AI tool factories. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- **Always** declare `ai.koog:http-client-okhttp` in **both** `androidMain.dependencies` and `jvmMain.dependencies`. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- **Always** check `grep -rn "OpenAIModels" shared/src/commonMain shared/src/jvmMain shared/src/androidMain --include="*.kt"` returns only comments in `KnownModels.kt`. Anything else is a regression. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-test-workarounds`)_
- **Never** add capabilities to `KnownModels` unless a feature needs them — the simple form avoids the static init entirely. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-test-workarounds`)_
- `AiTestResult` is part of `SettingsUiState.Content.aiTestResult` with default `Idle`. **Never** make it a `UiEvent`. _(from `2026-09-05-llm-provider-settings`)_
- **Always** keep the auto-fill rule in `OpenAiConfig.resolveBaseUrl(storedUrl, provider)` only. The UI delegates to it — changing both is a bug. _(from `2026-09-05-llm-provider-settings`)_
- `FakeTextGen` is parametrised: `(success, failureMessage, trackGenerateCalls)`. **Always** use `trackGenerateCalls = true` in VM tests that assert the no-key short-circuit. _(from `2026-09-05-llm-provider-settings`)_
- **Never** add an `aiApiKey` field to `SettingsUiState.Content`. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_
- **Never** add an `aiApiKey` (or any secret) field back to `SettingsRepository`. Adding one is a regression. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_
- `SettingsViewModel.processIntent(UpdateAiKey)` **always** writes only to `secureStorage`. **Never** call `settings.setAiKey(...)`. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_
- The password field on `AiProviderSettingsScreen` is a local `mutableStateOf`. **Never** lift it to the VM. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_

## Per-tag

### `ai`

- A passing `:androidApp:assembleDebug` is the cross-platform smoke test (it would have failed under the old stub). _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- `SettingsViewModel.testConnection()` **always** short-circuits with `Error("API key not configured")` when no key, **without** calling `textGen`. Tests assert this with `FakeTextGen(trackGenerateCalls = true)` and `assertEquals(emptyList(), textGen.generateCalls)`. _(from `2026-09-05-llm-provider-settings`)_
- The old `JvmPromptExecutorPort` and `AndroidPromptExecutorPort` files are deleted. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- The Test connection "probe" prompt is hard-coded: `"Reply with the single word: pong."` — change together with the system prompt if needed. _(from `2026-09-05-llm-provider-settings`)_
- The unified `KoogPromptExecutorPort` lives in `commonMain` and exposes `val executor: PromptExecutor` publicly for the platform `single<PromptExecutor>` binding. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_

### `compose`

- **BottomBar taps** now have a single source of truth: `navigator.navigateTopLevel(dest)` — no `selectedIndex` to keep in sync. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_
- **Desktop chrome** is unchanged from the user's perspective — the drawer still works exactly as before. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_
- **Menu sheet visibility** is `rememberSaveable` state in `AndroidShell` — survives config changes, not part of the back stack. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_
- **`NavDestination` (drawer enum)** remains for the desktop drawer's grouping by `NavGroup` — not removed, just no longer wired to mobile. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_
- **Per-tab backstacks** work as expected: open TaskDetail on Today, switch to Plans, switch back to Today → TaskDetail is restored. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_
- **`TasksScreen`** unchanged — it already takes `onNavigateToTask` / `onNavigateToCreateTask` callbacks; the per-tab sub-navigation state now lives in `TasksRoute` inside `AppNavHost` via `rememberSaveable`. _(from `2026-09-05-android-bottom-nav`)_

### `coroutines`

- `koinBridge` is for one-shot startup reads only — **not for** hot-path code, **not for** long-running operations. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- When the script's grep is broken (a stray `runBlocking` appears), fix it immediately; the helper exists specifically so this is detectable. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_

### `di`

- `koinBridge` is for one-shot startup reads only — **not for** hot-path code, **not for** long-running operations. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- When the script's grep is broken (a stray `runBlocking` appears), fix it immediately; the helper exists specifically so this is detectable. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_

### `kmp`

- A passing `:androidApp:assembleDebug` is the cross-platform smoke test (it would have failed under the old stub). _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- The old `JvmPromptExecutorPort` and `AndroidPromptExecutorPort` files are deleted. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- The unified `KoogPromptExecutorPort` lives in `commonMain` and exposes `val executor: PromptExecutor` publicly for the platform `single<PromptExecutor>` binding. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_

### `koin`

- `JvmAiDiGraphTest` keeps its `LLModel` override as a safety belt — if someone reintroduces `OpenAIModels.*`, this test fails at graph-build time. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-test-workarounds`)_
- `koinBridge` is for one-shot startup reads only — **not for** hot-path code, **not for** long-running operations. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_
- When adding a new AI tool, **always** bind its use case with **explicit `get<ConcreteTool>()`** if the use case's parameter is `SimpleTool<T>`: _(from `2026-09-05-koog-test-workarounds`)_
- When the script's grep is broken (a stray `runBlocking` appears), fix it immediately; the helper exists specifically so this is detectable. _(from `2026-09-05-koin-suspend-bridge`)_

### `koog`

- A passing `:androidApp:assembleDebug` is the cross-platform smoke test (it would have failed under the old stub). _(from `2026-09-05-koog-both-platforms`)_
- `JvmAiDiGraphTest` keeps its `LLModel` override as a safety belt — if someone reintroduces `OpenAIModels.*`, this test fails at graph-build time. _(from `2026-09-05-koog-test-workarounds`)_

### `secure-storage`

- Adding a new secret (e.g. another provider's API key) **always** follows the same pattern: new `KEY_*` constant, new config object, migration on first DataStore access, no DataStore copy. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_
- `AiApiKeyMigration` is wired through `koinBridge { ... }` inside the DataStore factory's `.also { ds -> ... }` block. See `koin-suspend-bridge` decision. _(from `2026-09-05-secret-storage-split`)_
