**Status: OPEN**

**Tracked as:** #440

**Found in:** the logging epic retrospective (MR-2), when `LogExporter` was
deleted instead of implemented.

**Symptom:** file logging works on both platforms, so a developer can now read
logs off a device — but a *user* cannot. There is no way to attach logs to a
bug report, which is the reason `FileLogWriter` was originally wanted
(`2026-09-23`).

**Already ruled out:** not a wiring bug. `LogExporter` had no implementations
and no consumers, so there was nothing to re-wire — the surface itself does
not exist.

**Try next, in this order:**

1. Decide the trigger surface first. A "Share logs" row in Settings →
   Developer/Debug is the obvious one; grep for what Settings already has
   before assuming.
2. Only then write the port. Android wants `ACTION_SEND` with a `FileProvider`
   over the log directory; desktop wants a copy-to-timestamped-dir plus
   clipboard. Two implementations, one interface — the shape
   `2026-09-23` already specified and that was correctly not built speculatively.
3. Re-check redaction at that point. `RedactingLogWriter` scrubs credentials
   from what is *written*, and the same writers produce the file, so an export
   carries the same guarantees — but an export leaves the device, so a
   deliberate review of what the file contains is warranted before shipping
   it.
