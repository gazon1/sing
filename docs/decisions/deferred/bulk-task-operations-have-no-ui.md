title: "Bulk Task Operations Have No Ui"

**Status: OPEN**

**Tracked as:** #441

**Found in:** MR-4, while deleting dead code. `TaskMutationsUseCase` was on
the deletion list and was **kept** — see the note below.

**Symptom:** `bulkComplete(ids)` and `bulkDelete(ids)` are implemented, unit
tested, and Koin-bound, but no ViewModel injects the use case. There is no
multi-select in the task list, so the atomicity guarantee those methods exist
to provide is never exercised in the running app.

**Already ruled out:** not dead code. `2026-09-05-refactoring-summary` created
the use case by collapsing five pass-through use cases, and
`2026-09-07-dogfooding-followups` stripped it back while keeping exactly these
two methods because they enforce fail-fast atomicity the repositories do not.
Six tests cover it. Deleting it would have reverted a deliberate decision.

**Try next:** this is a product gap, not a refactor. When multi-select lands,
`TaskMutationsUseCase` is already the correct entry point — wire it rather
than writing a second implementation beside it. Settle the design questions
first (selection model, confirm step, partial-failure UX for a batch where
some ids vanished).
